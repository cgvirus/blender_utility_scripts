# blender_utility_scripts
This repo is a collection of small utility scripts which is not going to be any addon. May be useful for faster production. All of these scripts are free to use without any limitation and any modification is welcome.
# Script Runner
These scripts are not going to be any addon. They can be run by either Blender Text Editor Panel or a very flexible addon named Script Runner. Download: https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Import-Export/Script_Runner
